          <p>
            This assistant is designed just for Dennalee: to help organize debts, explore payoff options,
            and understand the tradeoffs of using retirement money – all in plain English.
          </p>
          <p class="hero-note">
            Its not a tax or financial advisor. Instead, it helps you see the options, tradeoffs, and questions
            you may want to bring to a professional.

        <h3>How this assistant behaves</h3>
        <ul class="bullets">
          <li>Uses a calm, zero-judgment tone. Debt and money stress are treated as normal, not as failures.</li>
          <li>Helps list out debts, interest rates, and payments in a way that feels manageable.</li>
          <li>Explains pros and cons of using retirement funds in simple language.</li>
          <li>Suggests questions to ask a human tax or financial professional for big, irreversible moves.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What it does not do</h3>
        <ul class="bullets">
          <li>Does not give legal, tax, or investment advice.</li>
          <li>Does not make decisions for you or push you into a path.</li>
          <li>Does not talk to creditors or financial institutions on your behalf.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="small">
          Its a planning and clarity tool, not a replacement for professional advice.

          Internally, this assistant lives inside Nicolas OpenClaw environment with access to private data and
          tools. This public page is just a simple description so you can see how the project is framed.
        </p>
        <p class="small">
          If you want changes to the tone, what it focuses on, or how it explains things, just tell Nicolas
          and Starfunkle will update the assistant accordingly.
